# CrustyDB 2022 version
The original official [repo](https://github.com/UCHI-DB-COURSES/crustydb-22)

This GitHub repository provides most of the documentation that can be found on the internet. The code within the repository is the initial framework code for this teaching-oriented database. 

However, it's somewhat outdated, and the latest code has been refactored in some parts. 

Nevertheless, you can still use this 2022 version for learning, and there are open-source solutions for this version available on GitHub – publiced by students from the University of Chicago. I've tried one, and at least as of April 2025, the code still runs smoothly.
